# Project
Transformative NLP in Healthcare through Clinical Text Analysis with SpaCy

In the realm of clinical text analysis, the challenge lies in extracting actionable insights from vast volumes of medical text data. This unstructured data presents complexities, including the nuanced language used by medical professionals and the scarcity of labeled data for training. Current methodologies struggle to cope with these complexities, limiting their effectiveness in real-world medical scenarios. Our project aims to address these challenges by implementing advanced methods to unlock the full potential of unstructured clinical data for improved healthcare outcomes.
